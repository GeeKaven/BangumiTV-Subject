Blamed for Jameson losing contact with our Earth, Spider-Man becomes a target of persecution by the media and the public at large. With a bounty placed on his head. Believed to be dead after saving a person's life in a fire, Peter Parker uses the ruse to embark on a mission to retrieve John Jameson on Counter-Earth. His new Spider suit using nanotechnology discretely burrowed from Reed Richards to design a new suit that incorporates built in webshooters, stealth technology and anti-symbiote sonic weaponry. Making his way to the planet, Spider-Man learns that Jameson has fallen in with a band of freedom fighters opposed to the High Evolutionary whose Beastials, hybrids of animal and humanoid attributes, are the dominant species whilst humans are the second-class minority.\r\n\r\nWith Jameson reluctant to return until all of the Beastials are defeated, Spider-Man elects to remain on Counter-Earth, blending in as best as he can as Peter Parker, and fighting the High Evolutionary and his Knights of Wundagore alongside the rebels as Spider-Man. It is soon discovered that Venom and Carnage are also on Counter-Earth, and are following orders from the Synoptic, a hive-minded legion of Counter-Earth symbiotes. This series also shows the animated version of John Jameson's Man-Wolf form, as well as superhero versions of mainstream villains the Green Goblin and the Vulture.","name":"Spider-Man Unlimited","name_cn":"超级蜘蛛侠","tags":[{"name":"欧美","count":25,"total_cont":0},{"name":"童年","count":17,"total_cont":0},{"name":"TV","count":15,"total_cont":0},{"name":"蜘蛛侠","count":15,"total_cont":0},{"name":"Marvel","count":9,"total_cont":0},{"name":"1999","count":8,"total_cont":0},{"name":"好像没看全？","count":5,"total_cont":0},{"name":"漫画改","count":5,"total_cont":0},{"name":"漫改","count":5,"total_cont":0},{"name":"科幻","count":4,"total_cont":0},{"name":"腰斩","count":3,"total_cont":0},{"name":"超英","count":2,"total_cont":0},{"name":"战斗","count":2,"total_cont":0},{"name":"漫威","count":1,"total_cont":0}],"infobox":[{"key":"中文名","value":"超级蜘蛛侠"},{"key":"话数","value":"13"},{"key":"放送开始","value":"1999年10月2日"},{"key":"播放电视台","value":"Fox Kids"},{"key":"播放结束","value":"2001年3月31日"},{"key":"导演","value":"Patrick Archibald"},{"key":"音乐","value":"Jeremy Sweet、Ian Nickus、Shuki Levy、Kussa Mahchi、Ron Kenan"},{"key":"IMDb","value":"tt0207120"},{"key":"企画","value":"Avi Arad、Will Meugniot"},{"key":"原作","value":"Spider-Man by Stan Lee、Steve Ditko"},{"key":"系列构成","value":"Will Meugniot、Michael Reaves、Roger Slifer"},{"key":"脚本","value":"Larry Brody、Robert Gregory Browne、Mark Hoffmeier、Will Meugniot、Michael Reaves"},{"key":"演出","value":"Diane Duane、Peter Morwood、Steve Perry、Roger Slifer、Brynne Stephens"},{"key":"执行制片人","value":"Avi Arad、Eric S.
