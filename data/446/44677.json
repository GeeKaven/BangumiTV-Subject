A. Milne. The television series features Pooh and his friends, including two new characters: a brave 6-year-old red-headed girl named Darby and her pet dog and sidekick Buster. Although Darby appears to be the main human friend of Pooh and the gang and the leader of the Super Sleuths, Christopher Robin made only two appearances in the series.\r\n\r\nDeveloped by Walt Disney Television Animation, the show premiered on Disney Channel's Playhouse Disney block on May 12, 2007. The show's theme song is a pop song that is played at the beginning of each episode. It was written by Jellyfish lead singer Andy Sturmer and is performed by former Letters to Cleo singer Kay Hanley. In Season 2, Chloë Grace Moretz as Darby (replacing Kay Hanley) performed the theme. Also, beginning with this series Travis Oates assumed the role of Piglet, taking over for John Fiedler, who died in 2005, two years prior to the debut of the series.\r\n\r\nIn July 2010, My Friends Tigger & Pooh was omitted from the Playhouse Disney lineup, while it returned in October that same year with new episodes. After Playhouse Disney rebranded into Disney Junior on February 14, 2011, the show was off the air for five years until returning on September 12, 2016, for Pooh's 90th anniversary.\r\n\r\n","name":"My Friends Tigger & Pooh","name_cn":"小熊维尼与跳跳虎","tags":[{"name":"欧美","count":43,"total_cont":0},{"name":"TV","count":35,"total_cont":0},{"name":"童年","count":35,"total_cont":0},{"name":"迪士尼","count":25,"total_cont":0},{"name":"2007","count":18,"total_cont":0},{"name":"小熊维尼与跳跳虎","count":10,"total_cont":0},{"name":"子供向","count":8,"total_cont":0},{"name":"小熊维尼","count":5,"total_cont":0},{"name":"Disney","count":4,"total_cont":0},{"name":"原创","count":4,"total_cont":0},{"name":"3D","count":4,"total_cont":0},{"name":"维尼","count":3,"total_cont":0},{"name":"2008","count":3,"total_cont":0},{"name":"2007.04","count":2,"total_cont":0},{"name":"治愈","count":2,"total_cont":0},{"name":"童年补完计划","count":2,"total_cont":0},{"name":"日常","count":2,"total_cont":0},{"name":"欧美动画","count":1,"total_cont":0},{"name":"少儿频道","count":1,"total_cont":0},{"name":"others","count":1,"total_cont":0},{"name":"非常中意的","count":1,"total_cont":0},{"name":"Disney_Television_Animation","count":1,"total_cont":0},{"name":"北美","count":1,"total_cont":0},{"name":"没看全","count":1,"total_cont":0},{"name":"轻松","count":1,"total_cont":0},{"name":"电影","count":1,"total_cont":0},{"name":"垃圾","count":1,"total_cont":0},{"name":"萌","count":1,"total_cont":0},{"name":"美国","count":1,"total_cont":0},{"name":"动画","count":1,"total_cont":0}],"infobox":[{"key":"中文名","value":"小熊维尼与跳跳虎"},{"key":"话数","value":"63"},{"key":"放送开始","value":"2007年5月12日"},{"key":"播放电视台","value":"Disney Channel"},{"key":"播放结束","value":"2010年10月9日"}],"rating":{"rank":5506,"total":116,"count":{"1":2,"2":2,"3":3,"4":3,"5":17,"6":42,"7":34,"8":8,"9":2,"10":3},"score":6.2},"total_episodes":50,"collection":{"on_hold":8,"dropped":19,"wish":14,"collect":255,"doing":3},"id":44677,"eps":63,"meta_tags":["TV","子供向","欧美"],"volumes":0,"series":false,"locked":false,"nsfw":false,"type":2}
