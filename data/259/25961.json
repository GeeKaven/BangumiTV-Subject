It centers on a rivalry between its two main characters, Tom Cat and Jerry Mouse, and many recurring characters, based around slapstick comedy.\r\n\r\nIn its original run, Hanna and Barbera produced 114 Tom and Jerry shorts for Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer from 1940 to 1957. During this time, they won seven Academy Awards for Animated Short Film, tying for first place with Walt Disney's Silly Symphonies with the most awards in the category. After the MGM cartoon studio closed in 1957, MGM revived the series with Gene Deitch directing an additional 13 Tom and Jerry shorts for Rembrandt Films from 1960 to 1962. Tom and Jerry then became the highest-grossing animated short film series of that time, overtaking Looney Tunes. Chuck Jones then produced another 34 shorts with Sib-Tower 12 Productions between 1963 and 1967. Two more shorts were produced, The Mansion Cat in 2001 and The Karate Guard in 2005, for a total of 163 shorts. Various shorts have been released for home media since the 1990s.\r\n\r\nA number of spin-offs have been made, including the television series The Tom and Jerry Show (1975–77), The Tom and Jerry Comedy Show (1980–82), Tom & Jerry Kids (1990–94), Tom and Jerry Tales (2006–08), and The Tom and Jerry Show (2014-present). The first feature-length film based on the series, Tom and Jerry: The Movie, was released in 1992 before ten direct-to-video films were produced between 2002 and 2013.\r\n\r\nNumerous Tom and Jerry shorts have been subject to controversy, mainly over racial stereotypes which involves the portrayal of the recurring black character Mammy Two Shoes and characters appearing in blackface. Other controversial themes include cannibalism and the glamorization of smoking.","name":"Tom and Jerry","name_cn":"猫和老鼠","tags":[{"name":"童年","count":1501},{"name":"欧美","count":1043},{"name":"童年的经典","count":806},{"name":"搞笑","count":739},{"name":"Tom&Jerry","count":642},{"name":"经典","count":600},{"name":"TV","count":430},{"name":"神作","count":409},{"name":"汤姆杰瑞好基友","count":259},{"name":"爆笑","count":239},{"name":"美国","count":234},{"name":"童年回憶","count":129},{"name":"1940","count":124},{"name":"1965","count":89},{"name":"爆笑类","count":71},{"name":"原创","count":66},{"name":"日常","count":21},{"name":"猫和老鼠","count":17},{"name":"基","count":15},{"name":"米高梅","count":15},{"name":"没看全","count":10},{"name":"短片","count":8},{"name":"长篇","count":8},{"name":"音乐","count":8},{"name":"喜剧","count":7},{"name":"美国动画","count":7},{"name":"1940年","count":6},{"name":"童年回忆","count":6},{"name":"动画","count":5},{"name":"必看","count":5}],"infobox":[{"key":"中文名","value":"猫和老鼠"},{"key":"别名","value":[{"v":"Tom and Jerry (1960s packaged show)"},{"v":"猫和老鼠 电视播放版"},{"v":"湯姆貓與傑利鼠"}]},{"key":"话数","value":"161"},{"key":"放送开始","value":"1940年2月10日"},{"key":"播放电视台","value":"CBS Broadcasting"},{"key":"播放结束","value":"1967年9月8日"},{"key":"其他","value":"MGM版本(1940–1958)114集、Gene Deitch版本(1961–1962)13集、Chuck Jones版本(1963–1967)34集"},{"key":"制片国家/地区","value":"美国"},{"key":"语言","value":"英语"},{"key":"导演","value":"William Hanna (1940–58)→Joseph Barbera (1940–58)→Gene Deitch (1961–62) Chuck Jones (1963–67)、Maurice Noble (1964–67)、Abe Levitow (1965–67)、Tom Ray (1966–67)、Ben Washam (1966–67)"},{"key":"脚本","value":"William Hanna (1940–58)、Joseph Barbera (1940–58)→Gene Deitch (1961–62)、Eli Bauer (1961–62)、Larz Bourne (1961–62)→Michael Maltese (1963–67)、Jim Pabian (1965)、Bob Ogle (1966–67)、John W.
