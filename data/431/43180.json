In a panel discussion at San Diego Comic-Con 2012, Konietzko and DiMartino indicated that Book Two will take place six months after the first twelve episodes. They said that it will partially take place at the South Pole, in the Southern Water Tribe, and focus on the mystical \"Spirit World\" (hence the title \"Spirits\") and the history of the Avatar lineage and mythology. New characters include Tenzin's older sister Kya, a waterbender; Tenzin's non-bender older brother Bumi; Korra's paternal uncle Unalaq; and her first cousins, Desna and Eska. Two episodes, Beginnings 1 and 2, will tell the story of Wan, a bender who becomes the first Avatar as a result of his attempts to balance the human and spirit worlds.","name":"The Legend of Korra Book 2: Spirits","name_cn":"科拉传奇 第二季：神灵","tags":[{"name":"欧美","count":40},{"name":"降世神通","count":36},{"name":"科拉传奇","count":25},{"name":"TV","count":20},{"name":"美国","count":17},{"name":"2013","count":14},{"name":"奇幻","count":10},{"name":"原创","count":8},{"name":"美漫","count":8},{"name":"StudioMIR","count":7},{"name":"功夫","count":7},{"name":"武侠","count":4},{"name":"StudioPierrot","count":3},{"name":"中国元素","count":3},{"name":"战斗","count":3},{"name":"Avatar","count":2},{"name":"动作","count":2},{"name":"热血","count":2},{"name":"美国动画","count":2},{"name":"2013年","count":1},{"name":"Joaquim_Dos_Santos","count":1},{"name":"Ki_Hyun_Ryu","count":1},{"name":"Nickelodeon","count":1},{"name":"Studio_MIR","count":1},{"name":"动画","count":1},{"name":"神通","count":1},{"name":"科幻","count":1},{"name":"美TV","count":1},{"name":"電視","count":1},{"name":"韩国","count":1}],"infobox":[{"key":"中文名","value":"科拉传奇 第二季：神灵"},{"key":"话数","value":"14"},{"key":"放送开始","value":"2013年9月13日"},{"key":"官方网站","value":"http://www.nick.com/shows/legend-of-korra"},{"key":"播放电视台","value":"Nickelodeon"}],"rating":{"rank":1895,"total":142,"count":{"1":1,"2":0,"3":0,"4":1,"5":7,"6":26,"7":56,"8":38,"9":8,"10":5},"score":7.1},"total_episodes":14,"collection":{"on_hold":11,"dropped":15,"wish":60,"collect":200,"doing":14},"id":43180,"eps":14,"volumes":0,"locked":false,"nsfw":false,"type":2}
