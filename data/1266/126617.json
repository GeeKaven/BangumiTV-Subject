SpongeBob lives in a pineapple with his pet snail, Gary, loves his job as a fry cook at the Krusty Krab, and has a knack for getting into all kinds of trouble without really trying. When he's not getting on the nerves of his cranky next door neighbor Squidward, SpongeBob can usually be found smack in the middle of all sorts of strange situations with his best buddy, the simple yet lovable starfish, Patrick, or his thrill-seeking surfer-girl squirrel pal, Sandy Cheeks.","name":"SpongeBob SquarePants (Season 5)","name_cn":"海绵宝宝 第五季","tags":[{"name":"TV","count":20},{"name":"欧美","count":20},{"name":"2007","count":9},{"name":"童年","count":9},{"name":"搞笑","count":8},{"name":"动漫世界","count":7},{"name":"国配","count":6},{"name":"TV（集数1-49）","count":4},{"name":"海绵宝宝","count":4},{"name":"美国","count":4},{"name":"电视","count":3},{"name":"日常","count":2},{"name":"Animation","count":1},{"name":"北美","count":1},{"name":"原创","count":1},{"name":"奇幻","count":1},{"name":"正常","count":1},{"name":"没全部看完","count":1},{"name":"没看全","count":1},{"name":"美国动画","count":1}],"infobox":[{"key":"中文名","value":"海绵宝宝 第五季"},{"key":"话数","value":"39"},{"key":"放送开始","value":"2007-02-19"},{"key":"播放电视台","value":"Nickelodeon"},{"key":"播放结束","value":"2007-11-23"}],"rating":{"rank":2336,"total":70,"count":{"1":0,"2":0,"3":2,"4":2,"5":4,"6":13,"7":26,"8":17,"9":4,"10":2},"score":6.9},"total_episodes":39,"collection":{"on_hold":2,"dropped":7,"wish":5,"collect":136,"doing":2},"id":126617,"eps":39,"volumes":0,"locked":false,"nsfw":false,"type":2}
