SpongeBob lives in a pineapple with his pet snail, Gary, loves his job as a fry cook at the Krusty Krab, and has a knack for getting into all kinds of trouble without really trying. When he's not getting on the nerves of his cranky next door neighbor Squidward, SpongeBob can usually be found smack in the middle of all sorts of strange situations with his best buddy, the simple yet lovable starfish, Patrick, or his thrill-seeking surfer-girl squirrel pal, Sandy Cheeks.","name":"SpongeBob SquarePants (Season 6)","name_cn":"海绵宝宝 第六季","tags":[{"name":"欧美","count":25},{"name":"TV","count":19},{"name":"童年","count":15},{"name":"2008","count":12},{"name":"搞笑","count":11},{"name":"电视","count":7},{"name":"美国","count":6},{"name":"TV（集数1-49）","count":5},{"name":"美国动画","count":5},{"name":"海绵宝宝","count":4},{"name":"2000-2009","count":2},{"name":"没全部看完","count":2},{"name":"TVA-01","count":1},{"name":"undefined","count":1},{"name":"Animation","count":1},{"name":"没看全","count":1},{"name":"日常","count":1},{"name":"补旧番","count":1}],"infobox":[{"key":"中文名","value":"海绵宝宝 第六季"},{"key":"话数","value":"34"},{"key":"放送开始","value":"2008年3月3日"},{"key":"播放电视台","value":"Nickelodeon"},{"key":"播放结束","value":"2009年3月20日"}],"rating":{"rank":2557,"total":79,"count":{"1":1,"2":1,"3":2,"4":1,"5":6,"6":14,"7":30,"8":16,"9":1,"10":7},"score":6.9},"total_episodes":34,"collection":{"on_hold":8,"dropped":6,"wish":7,"collect":183,"doing":2},"id":126618,"eps":34,"volumes":0,"locked":false,"nsfw":false,"type":2}
