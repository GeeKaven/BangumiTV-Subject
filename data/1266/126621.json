SpongeBob lives in a pineapple with his pet snail, Gary, loves his job as a fry cook at the Krusty Krab, and has a knack for getting into all kinds of trouble without really trying. When he's not getting on the nerves of his cranky next door neighbor Squidward, SpongeBob can usually be found smack in the middle of all sorts of strange situations with his best buddy, the simple yet lovable starfish, Patrick, or his thrill-seeking surfer-girl squirrel pal, Sandy Cheeks.","name":"SpongeBob SquarePants (Season 9)","name_cn":"海绵宝宝 第九季","tags":[{"name":"TV","count":20,"total_cont":0},{"name":"童年","count":14,"total_cont":0},{"name":"欧美","count":14,"total_cont":0},{"name":"2011","count":10,"total_cont":0},{"name":"美国动画","count":9,"total_cont":0},{"name":"原创","count":9,"total_cont":0},{"name":"搞笑","count":5,"total_cont":0},{"name":"TV（集数1-49）","count":3,"total_cont":0},{"name":"美漫","count":3,"total_cont":0},{"name":"海绵宝宝","count":3,"total_cont":0},{"name":"2010-2019","count":2,"total_cont":0},{"name":"美国","count":2,"total_cont":0},{"name":"已完结","count":2,"total_cont":0},{"name":"Animation","count":2,"total_cont":0},{"name":"undefined","count":1,"total_cont":0},{"name":"动画","count":1,"total_cont":0}],"infobox":[{"key":"中文名","value":"海绵宝宝 第九季"},{"key":"话数","value":"42"},{"key":"放送开始","value":"2011年4月3日"},{"key":"播放电视台","value":"Nickelodeon"},{"key":"播放结束","value":"2012年7月21日"}],"rating":{"rank":2775,"total":81,"count":{"1":1,"2":0,"3":2,"4":5,"5":6,"6":17,"7":27,"8":11,"9":1,"10":11},"score":6.9},"total_episodes":42,"collection":{"on_hold":5,"dropped":14,"wish":12,"collect":200,"doing":7},"id":126621,"eps":42,"meta_tags":["TV","欧美"],"volumes":0,"series":false,"locked":false,"nsfw":false,"type":2}
