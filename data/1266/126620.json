SpongeBob lives in a pineapple with his pet snail, Gary, loves his job as a fry cook at the Krusty Krab, and has a knack for getting into all kinds of trouble without really trying. When he's not getting on the nerves of his cranky next door neighbor Squidward, SpongeBob can usually be found smack in the middle of all sorts of strange situations with his best buddy, the simple yet lovable starfish, Patrick, or his thrill-seeking surfer-girl squirrel pal, Sandy Cheeks.","name":"SpongeBob SquarePants (Season 8)","name_cn":"海绵宝宝 第八季","tags":[{"name":"欧美","count":32,"total_cont":0},{"name":"TV","count":27,"total_cont":0},{"name":"童年","count":25,"total_cont":0},{"name":"美国动画","count":19,"total_cont":0},{"name":"海绵宝宝","count":17,"total_cont":0},{"name":"2010","count":13,"total_cont":0},{"name":"TV（集数1-49）","count":9,"total_cont":0},{"name":"搞笑","count":9,"total_cont":0},{"name":"原创","count":8,"total_cont":0},{"name":"美漫","count":4,"total_cont":0},{"name":"美国","count":4,"total_cont":0},{"name":"2010-2019","count":3,"total_cont":0},{"name":"动画","count":2,"total_cont":0},{"name":"Animation","count":2,"total_cont":0},{"name":"童年经典","count":1,"total_cont":0},{"name":"已完结","count":1,"total_cont":0}],"infobox":[{"key":"中文名","value":"海绵宝宝 第八季"},{"key":"话数","value":"26"},{"key":"放送开始","value":"2010年7月8日"},{"key":"播放电视台","value":"Nickelodeon"},{"key":"播放结束","value":"2011年2月26日"}],"rating":{"rank":2859,"total":126,"count":{"1":1,"2":2,"3":1,"4":3,"5":11,"6":28,"7":44,"8":22,"9":2,"10":12},"score":6.9},"total_episodes":26,"collection":{"on_hold":9,"dropped":14,"wish":19,"collect":313,"doing":7},"id":126620,"eps":26,"meta_tags":["TV","欧美"],"volumes":0,"series":false,"locked":false,"nsfw":false,"type":2}
