SpongeBob lives in a pineapple with his pet snail, Gary, loves his job as a fry cook at the Krusty Krab, and has a knack for getting into all kinds of trouble without really trying. When he's not getting on the nerves of his cranky next door neighbor Squidward, SpongeBob can usually be found smack in the middle of all sorts of strange situations with his best buddy, the simple yet lovable starfish, Patrick, or his thrill-seeking surfer-girl squirrel pal, Sandy Cheeks.","name":"SpongeBob SquarePants (Season 4)","name_cn":"海绵宝宝 第四季","tags":[{"name":"欧美","count":73},{"name":"童年","count":65},{"name":"TV","count":55},{"name":"搞笑","count":50},{"name":"2005","count":27},{"name":"美国","count":24},{"name":"日常","count":21},{"name":"动漫世界","count":17},{"name":"2007","count":10},{"name":"一般向","count":9},{"name":"TV（集数1-49）","count":7},{"name":"原创","count":7},{"name":"电视","count":7},{"name":"没看全","count":4},{"name":"电视上看的","count":4},{"name":"美国动画","count":3},{"name":"海绵宝宝","count":3},{"name":"童年的经典","count":2},{"name":"美漫","count":2},{"name":"2000-2009","count":2},{"name":"奇幻","count":2},{"name":"undefined","count":1},{"name":"外国","count":1},{"name":"没全部看完","count":1},{"name":"黑色幽默","count":1},{"name":"Animation","count":1},{"name":"动画","count":1},{"name":"动物","count":1},{"name":"9","count":1},{"name":"其它","count":1}],"infobox":[{"key":"中文名","value":"海绵宝宝 第四季"},{"key":"话数","value":"38"},{"key":"放送开始","value":"2005年5月6日"},{"key":"播放电视台","value":"Nickelodeon"},{"key":"播放结束","value":"2007年7月24日"}],"rating":{"rank":1540,"total":245,"count":{"1":1,"2":0,"3":4,"4":3,"5":10,"6":24,"7":106,"8":67,"9":11,"10":19},"score":7.3},"total_episodes":38,"collection":{"on_hold":7,"dropped":15,"wish":13,"collect":539,"doing":9},"id":126616,"eps":38,"volumes":0,"series":false,"locked":false,"nsfw":false,"type":2}
