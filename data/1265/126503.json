The series follows the dysfunctional Griffin family—father Peter, mother Lois, daughter Meg, son Chris, baby Stewie and their anthropomorphic dog Brian, all of whom reside in their hometown of Quahog. The show features the voices of series creator Seth MacFarlane, Alex Borstein, Seth Green, Lacey Chabert and later Mila Kunis in the roles of the Griffin family. The executive producers for the first season were David Zuckerman and MacFarlane. By the end of the second season, due to low ratings, Fox resorted to canceling Family Guy. However, following a last-minute reprieve, it returned for a third season in 2001. The series was canceled again in 2002; however, high ratings on Adult Swim and high DVD sales renewed Fox's interest in the series. The series returned for a total of 35 new episodes in 2005. The season received a favorable reception from critics, who called the series \"extremely witty and darkly hilarious,\" and was \"unfortunately\" canceled. The Volume One DVD box set was released in Region 1 on April 15, 2003 and Region 2 on November 12, 2001. All twenty-one of the season's episodes are included in the volume. The first season's seven episodes were also included in the volume.","name":"Family Guy (Season 2)","name_cn":"恶搞之家 第二季","tags":[{"name":"欧美","count":22,"total_cont":0},{"name":"搞笑","count":19,"total_cont":0},{"name":"原创","count":18,"total_cont":0},{"name":"TV","count":16,"total_cont":0},{"name":"恶搞之家","count":14,"total_cont":0},{"name":"1999","count":11,"total_cont":0},{"name":"美国","count":9,"total_cont":0},{"name":"动画","count":5,"total_cont":0},{"name":"TVA-02","count":3,"total_cont":0},{"name":"19","count":3,"total_cont":0},{"name":"还行","count":3,"total_cont":0},{"name":"Seth_MacFarlane","count":2,"total_cont":0},{"name":"美漫","count":1,"total_cont":0},{"name":"1999年9月","count":1,"total_cont":0},{"name":"黄暴","count":1,"total_cont":0}],"infobox":[{"key":"中文名","value":"恶搞之家 第二季"},{"key":"话数","value":"21"},{"key":"放送开始","value":"1999年9月23日"},{"key":"播放电视台","value":"FOX"},{"key":"播放结束","value":"2000年8月1日"}],"rating":{"rank":2871,"total":66,"count":{"1":0,"2":1,"3":0,"4":2,"5":4,"6":16,"7":27,"8":12,"9":2,"10":2},"score":6.8},"total_episodes":21,"collection":{"on_hold":9,"dropped":8,"wish":9,"collect":129,"doing":38},"id":126503,"eps":21,"meta_tags":["TV","原创","欧美"],"volumes":0,"series":false,"locked":false,"nsfw":false,"type":2}
