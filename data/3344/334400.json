Due to the major expenses from the previous seasons' artifact hunts, Valmont is rendered bankrupt and the Dark Hand is no more. With nothing to lose, Valmont orders his three enforcers to break into Section 13 and steal the Twelve Talismans of Shendu.\r\n\r\nThey encounter the Dark Wizard Daolon Wong who has just arrived to San Francisco for the same purpose. To stop anybody from getting the Talismans again, Jackie destroys them with a powerful laser cannon. However, this merely releases the powers held within which then relocate to the Twelve Noble Animals - restarting the Talisman hunt from season 1, only now they must compete with Daolon Wong who has now transformed the enforcers into his Dark Chi Warriors after Uncle imprisoned his original set. The Chans must find and secure each animal gifted with their ancestor's power before Wong can attain the powers for himself.","name":"Jackie Chan Adventures Season 3","name_cn":"成龙历险记 第三季","tags":[{"name":"童年","count":184},{"name":"欧美","count":167},{"name":"成龙历险记","count":121},{"name":"TV","count":97},{"name":"原创","count":89},{"name":"2002","count":83},{"name":"奇幻","count":81},{"name":"战斗","count":77},{"name":"搞笑","count":67},{"name":"冒险","count":41},{"name":"龙之宝工作室","count":29},{"name":"热血","count":16},{"name":"美漫","count":12},{"name":"美国","count":11},{"name":"西方剧集","count":7},{"name":"中国元素","count":4},{"name":"剧集","count":4},{"name":"国产","count":3},{"name":"Frank_Squillace","count":3},{"name":"美国动画","count":2},{"name":"续作","count":2},{"name":"国产动画","count":2},{"name":"补标","count":2},{"name":"2000-2009","count":2},{"name":"2002年","count":2},{"name":"番剧","count":2},{"name":"TVA","count":2},{"name":"二等","count":1},{"name":"欧美TV","count":1},{"name":"00年代","count":1}],"infobox":[{"key":"中文名","value":"成龙历险记 第三季"},{"key":"话数","value":"17"},{"key":"放送开始","value":"2002年9月14日"},{"key":"播放结束","value":"2003年5月3日"},{"key":"企画","value":"John Rogers"},{"key":"执行制片人","value":"蘇志鴻"}],"rating":{"rank":824,"total":869,"count":{"1":2,"2":0,"3":0,"4":4,"5":15,"6":80,"7":314,"8":343,"9":64,"10":47},"score":7.6},"total_episodes":17,"collection":{"on_hold":17,"dropped":17,"wish":24,"collect":1839,"doing":8},"id":334400,"eps":17,"volumes":0,"series":false,"locked":false,"nsfw":false,"type":2}
