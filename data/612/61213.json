In the present, the place is the Hotel Transylvania, where monsters bring their families to vacation far from the frightening humans. Dracula invites his friends - Frankenstein and his wife Eunice; Wayne and Wanda, the werewolves; Griffin, the invisible man; Murray, the mummy; Bigfoot, among others - to celebrate the 118th birthday of Mavis. When the party is ready to start, the 21-year-old Jonathan is walking through the forest and stumbles upon the hotel. Dracula sees Jonathan and disguises him as a monster to hide Jonathan from the guests. But Mavis also sees Jonathan and Dracula forces him to pose as a monster. Soon Mavis believes that Jonathan is the \"zing\" of her life despite the advice of her father about humans.","name":"Hotel Transylvania","name_cn":"精灵旅社","tags":[{"name":"欧美","count":155,"total_cont":0},{"name":"剧场版","count":110,"total_cont":0},{"name":"动画电影","count":103,"total_cont":0},{"name":"2012","count":87,"total_cont":0},{"name":"吸血鬼","count":72,"total_cont":0},{"name":"美国","count":46,"total_cont":0},{"name":"3D","count":43,"total_cont":0},{"name":"奇幻","count":41,"total_cont":0},{"name":"SONY","count":35,"total_cont":0},{"name":"原创","count":29,"total_cont":0},{"name":"电影","count":29,"total_cont":0},{"name":"索尼","count":21,"total_cont":0},{"name":"ANIMETHEMOVIE","count":18,"total_cont":0},{"name":"鬼父","count":12,"total_cont":0},{"name":"美国动画","count":6,"total_cont":0},{"name":"搞笑","count":6,"total_cont":0},{"name":"迪士尼","count":4,"total_cont":0},{"name":"精灵旅社","count":2,"total_cont":0},{"name":"2012年","count":2,"total_cont":0},{"name":"電影","count":2,"total_cont":0},{"name":"补标","count":2,"total_cont":0},{"name":"【6星】","count":1,"total_cont":0},{"name":"SonyPicturesAnimation","count":1,"total_cont":0},{"name":"2刷","count":1,"total_cont":0},{"name":"外国","count":1,"total_cont":0},{"name":"欧美电影","count":1,"total_cont":0},{"name":"Sony_Pictures_Animation","count":1,"total_cont":0},{"name":"Genndy","count":1,"total_cont":0},{"name":"Tartakovsky","count":1,"total_cont":0},{"name":"动画（剧场版）","count":1,"total_cont":0}],"infobox":[{"key":"中文名","value":"精灵旅社"},{"key":"别名","value":[{"v":"尖叫旅社(台)"},{"v":"鬼灵精怪大酒店(港)"},{"v":"怪物旅店"},{"v":"特兰西瓦尼亚酒店"},{"v":"怪物酒店"}]},{"key":"上映年度","value":"2012年9月28日"},{"key":"片长","value":"92分钟"},{"key":"官方网站","value":"http://www.welcometohotelt.com/"},{"key":"制片国家/地区","value":"美国"},{"key":"IMDb链接","value":"tt0837562"},{"key":"语言","value":"英语"},{"key":"导演","value":"Genndy Tartakovsky"},{"key":"编剧","value":"Peter Baynham、Robert Smigel"},{"key":"话数","value":"1"},{"key":"原案","value":"Todd Durham、Kevin Hageman、Dan Hageman"},{"key":"制片人","value":"Michelle Murdocca"},{"key":"音乐","value":"Mark Mothersbaugh"},{"key":"製作","value":"Columbia Pictures、Sony Pictures Animation、Sony Pictures Imageworks"},{"key":"动画制作","value":"Sony Pictures Animation、Sony Pictures Imageworks"},{"key":"发行","value":"Sony Pictures Releasing"},{"key":"主演","value":"Adam Sandler / Andy Samberg / Selena Gomez / Kevin James / Fran Drescher / Steve Buscemi / Molly Shannon / David Spade / Jon Lovitz / CeeLo Green / Brian George / Luenell Campell / Brian Stack / Chris Parnell / Jackie Sandler / Sadie Sandler / Robert Smigel / Rob Riggle / Paul Brittain"}],"rating":{"rank":3839,"total":501,"count":{"1":0,"2":0,"3":4,"4":8,"5":33,"6":152,"7":223,"8":68,"9":7,"10":6},"score":6.7},"total_episodes":1,"collection":{"on_hold":15,"dropped":14,"wish":77,"collect":1004,"doing":8},"id":61213,"eps":1,"meta_tags":["剧场版","原创","美国","欧美"],"volumes":0,"series":false,"locked":false,"nsfw":false,"type":2}
