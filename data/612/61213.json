In the present, the place is the Hotel Transylvania, where monsters bring their families to vacation far from the frightening humans. Dracula invites his friends - Frankenstein and his wife Eunice; Wayne and Wanda, the werewolves; Griffin, the invisible man; Murray, the mummy; Bigfoot, among others - to celebrate the 118th birthday of Mavis. When the party is ready to start, the 21-year-old Jonathan is walking through the forest and stumbles upon the hotel. Dracula sees Jonathan and disguises him as a monster to hide Jonathan from the guests. But Mavis also sees Jonathan and Dracula forces him to pose as a monster. Soon Mavis believes that Jonathan is the \"zing\" of her life despite the advice of her father about humans.","name":"Hotel Transylvania","name_cn":"精灵旅社","tags":[{"name":"欧美","count":86},{"name":"剧场版","count":61},{"name":"动画电影","count":58},{"name":"2012","count":45},{"name":"吸血鬼","count":43},{"name":"美国","count":24},{"name":"3D","count":23},{"name":"电影","count":19},{"name":"SONY","count":17},{"name":"索尼","count":17},{"name":"ANIMETHEMOVIE","count":15},{"name":"奇幻","count":13},{"name":"鬼父","count":11},{"name":"原创","count":8},{"name":"美国动画","count":6},{"name":"搞笑","count":2},{"name":"電影","count":2},{"name":"2010s","count":1},{"name":"8WA","count":1},{"name":"Sony_Pictures_Animation","count":1},{"name":"【6星】","count":1},{"name":"【ANIME】电影丨美国","count":1},{"name":"喜剧","count":1},{"name":"成长","count":1},{"name":"欧美电影","count":1},{"name":"米国","count":1},{"name":"精灵旅社","count":1},{"name":"美国动画电影","count":1},{"name":"萌","count":1},{"name":"非日本动画","count":1}],"infobox":[{"key":"中文名","value":"精灵旅社"},{"key":"别名","value":[{"v":"尖叫旅社(台)"},{"v":"鬼灵精怪大酒店(港)"},{"v":"怪物旅店"},{"v":"特兰西瓦尼亚酒店"},{"v":"怪物酒店"}]},{"key":"上映年度","value":"2012年9月28日"},{"key":"片长","value":"91分钟"},{"key":"官方网站","value":"http://www.welcometohotelt.com/"},{"key":"其他","value":"2013年11月1日(中国大陆)"},{"key":"发行商","value":"哥伦比亚影片公司"},{"key":"制片国家/地区","value":"美国"},{"key":"IMDb链接","value":"tt0837562"},{"key":"语言","value":"英语"},{"key":"导演","value":"Genndy Tartakovsky"},{"key":"编剧","value":"Peter Baynham / Robert Smigel / Todd Durham / Kevin Hageman / Dan Hageman"},{"key":"主演","value":"Adam Sandler / Andy Samberg / Selena Gomez / Kevin James / Fran Drescher / Steve Buscemi / Molly Shannon / David Spade / Jon Lovitz / CeeLo Green / Brian George / Luenell Campell / Brian Stack / Chris Parnell / Jackie Sandler / Sadie Sandler / Robert Smigel / Rob Riggle / Paul Brittain"},{"key":"话数","value":"1"}],"rating":{"rank":3109,"total":274,"count":{"1":0,"2":0,"3":1,"4":2,"5":17,"6":76,"7":130,"8":41,"9":6,"10":1},"score":6.8},"total_episodes":1,"collection":{"on_hold":7,"dropped":7,"wish":45,"collect":495,"doing":1},"id":61213,"eps":1,"volumes":0,"locked":false,"nsfw":false,"type":2}
